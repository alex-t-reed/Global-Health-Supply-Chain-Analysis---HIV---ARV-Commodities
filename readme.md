## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of global spending on specific health commodities, particularly ARV and HIV lab shipments. When analyzed in conjunction with related data sources such as the Global Fund's Price, Quality, and Reporting (PQR) data, this dataset offers a holistic view of the global health supply chain landscape in 2022.

## Key Insights

This section provides a summary of the key insights derived from the data analysis:

- Analysis of pricing ranges and trends for health commodities.
- Volumes of commodities delivered by country, offering insights into distribution patterns.
- Support for data-driven decision-making in the global health sector.
